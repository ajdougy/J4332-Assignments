I think this repository (https://github.com/newsdev/nyt-fec.git) from the New York Times regarding campaign finance data is interesting because it allows for NYT reporters to be able to get the campaign finance data they need from the FEC without having to struggle with an annoying and outdated government website. From my own personal experience of having to use the Columbia city website to find data and other information, I have a decent idea of how much time a tool like this could save reporters, and how it could allow for more information to be parsed through just because everything is readily available rather than hidden within infinite PDFs and links. It seems like the program itself is a web scraper, that takes information from the FEC's website and presents it in a database that is much more easily searchable.
